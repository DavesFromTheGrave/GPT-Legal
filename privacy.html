  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: October 7, 2025</p>

  <p>This privacy policy applies to AI projects, agents, and experiments created by Revenant Systems LLC (including any affiliated aliases or AI personas) and deployed using third-party large language model (LLM) platforms.</p>

  <h2>Data Usage</h2>
  <p>These AI systems process user input in real-time using external LLM APIs. Inputs are used solely to generate immediate responses within the current session. No data is stored, logged, or shared by Revenant Systems outside of the session context.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>User input may be sent to one or more third-party language model APIs, including but not limited to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>OpenAI (e.g. GPT-4, GPT-4o)</li>
    <li>Google Gemini</li>
    <li>Anthropic Claude</li>
    <li>Mistral</li>
    <li>Perplexity</li>
    <li>Other providers as experimentation evolves</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These services have their own privacy policies and data handling practices, which apply when your input is routed to them.</p>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <p>Revenant Systems LLC does not collect or retain any user input or output. Sessions are ephemeral unless explicitly saved by the user through platform features provided by the underlying service (e.g., OpenAI chat history).</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>For questions or concerns about AI usage or data handling, please contact: <strong>legal@revenantsystems.dev</strong></p>

  <p>This policy may be updated at any time without notice. Please refer to the URL for the latest version.</p>
